Hi!

Welcome to our awesome project.

To view the source java code of the applet itself, just look into the src folder.

For the rails app, just look into the NLab folder 
Tests: Since you must have rails to run the rspec tests, I've included a folder of pictures showing the tests running. You can find the source code for the tests in the /test folder. The main tests reside in the unit and functionality test folders.

The rails app contains a compiled jar file of the java source code in the public/applet folder. This is how the applet is embedded into the website.

Enjoy!
